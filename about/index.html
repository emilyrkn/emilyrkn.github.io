<h1>about me</h1>
<br>
<p>As an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I am interested in phonetics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics.</p>
<p>Specifically, my curiosities lie within the perception and recognition of speech sounds by both humans and the technologies surrounding us.</p>
<p>After finishing my undergraduate studies, I hope to pursue graduate school to continue my research.</p>
