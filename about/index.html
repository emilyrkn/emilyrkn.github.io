<h1>about me</h1>
<br>
<p>As a fledgling linguist, I am interested in phonetics, phonology, and computational linguistics.</p>
<p>Particularly, my curiosities lie with the perception and recognition of speech sounds by both humans and the technologies surrounding us.</p>
<p>I have specific interests in both English and Japanese, as well as digitally underrepresented languages such as Ainu.</p>
