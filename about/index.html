<h1>about me</h1>
<br>
<p><img class="smaller" src="/css/emily.JPEG" alt="That's me!"></p>
<p>As an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I am interested in phonetics and speech perception. I am a research assistant in the Phonetics Lab.</p>
<p>My curiosities are currently centered around the general auditory processes of perception, the relationship between perception and production, the phonetics-phonology interface, and voicing contrasts in languages around the world.</p>
<p>After finishing my undergraduate studies, I hope to pursue graduate school to continue my exploration of speech perception.</p>
<p>Outside of linguistics, I am an avid film-watcher and consumer of pad thai.</p>
