<h1>about me</h1>
<br>
<p>As an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, I am interested in speech perception, phonetics, and Japonic languages.</p>
<p>My curiosities are currently centered around the relationship between perception and production, the phonetics-phonology interface, and voicing contrasts in languages around the world.
<p>After finishing my undergraduate studies, I hope to pursue graduate school to continue my research.</p>
